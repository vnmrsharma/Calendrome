## Inspiration
Being students in college, we know how busy life can get. Sometimes we are so caught up with assignments and everything else that we barely make time for social interactions. This inspired us to create Calendrome, a social platform that allows people to collaboratively manage their time while having fun with their friends.

## What it does
Once the user arrives to the website, they will be taken to the homepage where they can discover more details about this initiative. They can create an account as well as a profile. If they have an account, they can sign in. Once this is done, they can connect with other people as well as attend events. Moreover, each user will have a shareable calendar that lets other people know when they are free available for meetups, events, parties, etc.

## How we built it
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS
- Backend: Node.js
- User auth: Google Firebase

## Challenges we ran into
- Most of our teammates were complete beginners and didn't have much experience building a full stack web application.
- Coming up with a feasible idea that could be implemented within the given time frame.
- Using new technologies such as Bootstrap, etc.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Helping each other out and working together as a team
- Completing the project in the given time frame despite schedule conflicts
- Using the minimalistic design, which makes the website easy to use

## What we learned
- Efficient collaboration with other developers
- How to build a functional application

## What's next for Untitled
- Building a mobile app for the project.
- Adding more features (safety, etc.)
- Increasing user optimization by utilizing ML and AI
